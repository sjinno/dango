        Django Dango
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Dango (団子) is a Japanese dumpling made from rice flour mixed with
        uruchi rice flour and glutinous rice flour. It is different from the
        method of making mochi, which is made after steaming glutinous rice.
        Dango is usually finished round shaped, three to five dango are often
        served on a skewer (skewered dango pieces called kushi-dango (串団子)).
        Generally, Dango comes under the category of Wagashi, and is often
        served with green tea. It is eaten year-round, but the different
        varieties are traditionally eaten in given seasons.
